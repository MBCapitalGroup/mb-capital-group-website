# Render Deployment Fix V2 - Simplified Build Process

## Issue Analysis:
The build was still failing with status 127 because the render.yaml was trying to use `npm run build` which relied on a complex build process that wasn't working properly in Render's environment.

## Solution Applied:
**Simplified the build process directly in render.yaml:**

### Old Build Command:
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
```

### New Build Command:
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist --target=es2022
```

### Updated Start Command:
```yaml
startCommand: node dist/index.js
```

## Why This Works:
1. **Direct esbuild execution** - No dependency on package.json scripts
2. **Simplified bundling** - Creates a single bundled file in dist/index.js
3. **Modern ES modules** - Uses ESM format with proper Node.js targeting
4. **External packages** - Keeps node_modules dependencies external for proper resolution

## Next Steps:
1. **Upload updated render.yaml** to GitHub repository
2. **Trigger new deployment** with "Clear build cache & deploy"
3. **Monitor build logs** - should complete successfully this time

## Expected Result:
- Build completes without status 127 error
- Server starts and connects to mbcapital_database
- Website becomes accessible on Render URL
- Ready for custom domain setup

This simplified approach eliminates the build complexity that was causing the deployment failures.
